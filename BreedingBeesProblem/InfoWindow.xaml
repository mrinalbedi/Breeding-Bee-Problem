                "Professor B. Heif is conducting experiments with a species of South American bees that he found
                during an expedition to the Brazilian rain forest. The honey produced by these bees is of superior
                quality compared to the honey from European and North American honey bees. Unfortunately,
                the bees do not breed well in captivity. Professor Heif thinks the reason is that the placement of
                the different maggots (for workers, queens, etc.) within the honeycomb depends on
                environmental conditions, which are different in his laboratory and the rain forest.

                As a first step to validate his theory, Professor Heif wants to quantify the difference in maggot
                placement. For this he measures the distance between the cells of the comb into which the
                maggots are placed. To this end, the professor has labeled the cells by marking an arbitrary cell
                as number 1, and then labeling the remaining cells in a clockwise fashion, as shown in the
                following figure."
